      <h2>Types of Drugs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Drug 1
            <p><u>Stimulants</u></p> 
<p>Stimulants increase activity in the central nervous system. The increased brain activity can make you feel like you’re speeding up. </p>
<p>Stimulants can increase your heart rate, blood pressure, and levels of alertness. These drugs typically come in pill form. However, they can also be eaten, drank, or snorted</p>. 
<p>Doctors usually prescribe stimulants for ADHD and narcolepsy. Stimulants can also help with weight loss as they can reduce appetite.</p>. 
<p>Some examples of stimulants include:</p>

<p>Adderall</p>
<p>Ritalin</p>
<p>Synthetic marijuana</p>
<p>Cocaine</p>
<p>Methamphetamine</p>
<p>Ecstasy</p>
<p>Caffeine</p>
<p>Associated Risks</p>
<p>Students or athletes can abuse these substances to improve their performance. When abused, stimulants can lead to a variety of unwanted consequences.</p>
<p>These effects can include:</p>

<p>Anxiety</p>
<p>Paranoia</p>
<p>Psychosis</p>
<p>High body temperature</p>
<p>Depression<p>
<p>Heart failure</p>
<p>Stroke</p>
<p>Seizures</p>
        </li>
        <li>Drug 2
            <p><u>Opioids</u></p>
<p></p>Opioids are powerful painkillers that can give you a sense of euphoria. Doctors typically prescribe opioids to people experiencing severe pain.</p>

<p>These drugs can reduce pain perception and cause drowsiness. Other effects include confusion, nausea, and constipation.</p>

<p>Opioids can be injected or consumed as pills.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of opioids:</p>

<p>Heroin</p>
<p>Morphine</p>
<p>Hydrocodone</p>
<p>Opium</p>
<p>Norco</p>
<p>OxyContin</p>
<p>Percocet</p>
<p>Codeine</p>
<p>Associated Risks</p>
<p>Opioid abuse can ruin a person’s life. Because it’s highly addictive, it can get a person addicted in just a few days. In rare cases, it’s possible to become addicted after one dose.</p>

<p>When someone decides to stop opioid use, they can struggle with withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms include:</p>

<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Anxiety</p>
<p>Inability to sleep</p>
<p>Hot and cold flashes
<p>Excessive sweating</p>
<p>Muscle cramps</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>Watery eyes</p>
<p>Sweating</p>
        </li>
        <li>Drug 3
           <p><u>Depressants</u></p>
        <p>Depressants don’t actually make you feel depressed. Like stimulants, they affect the central nervous system and slow down the messages between the brain and the body.</p>

    <p>This ‘slowing down’ effect can affect your cognitive and motor functions. It can even slow down your responses to whatever’s happening around you.</p>

<p>he depressant’s sedative effect makes people feel relaxed. Because of this, these drugs are prescribed for anxiety or insomnia. </p>

<p>Some examples of depressants include:</p>

<p>Barbiturates</p>
<p>Phenobarbital</p>
<p>Pentobarbital</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines</p>
<p>Xanax</p>
<p>Valium</p>
<p>Alcohol</p>
<p>Associated Risks</p>
<p>Depressants can be helpful when taken correctly. However, their sedative effects can be tempting for people experiencing stress.</p>

<p>Abusing depressants can cause issues both long and short-term, including:</p>

<p>Confusion</p>
<p>Dizziness</p>
<p>Extreme sleepiness</p>
<p>Slowed heart rate</p>
<p>Difficulty speaking</p>
<p>Inability to concentrate</p>
<p>Lack of coordination</p>
<p>Labored or shallow breathing</p>
<p>Death</p>

      <h2>Effects of Drugs</h2>
      <p>Drugs affect your whole life
        Drugs don’t just affect your physical body and health, they can affect your mental health, your finances, your relationships, your social life and your criminal record.</p>
        
       <p> Physical effects can vary
        The way a drug affects you depends on:</p>
        
        <p> drug itself</p>
       <P> what type of drug it is</P>
       <p>how you took it</p>
        <p>how much you took</p>
        <p>how strong or pure it is</p>
        <p>how often you take it</p>
        <p>your own body</p>
        <p>your gender</p>
        <p>physical size</p>
        <p>mood</p>
        <p>personality</p>
        <p>expectations</p>
        <p>how recently you ate</p>
        <p>your general health</p>
        <p>have you become tolerant?</p>
        <p>other drugs you took with it – for example, alcohol.
          Each drug causes different physical reactions, depending on the type of drug. Some will make you feel more awake, alert and energetic. Others will give you a calm, relaxed feeling. Some alter your perceptions and can cause hallucinations. Others may make you feel numb.</p>
        
        <p>Long-term use and larger doses have negative effects that can seriously harm your health, even cause death, including disease risks from sharing needles, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs.</p>
        
        <p>Visit the Alcohol and Drug Foundation website to learn about individual drugs and their effects.</p>
        
        <p>Other effects</p>
           Mental health
           Studies show that drug use increases your risk of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and psychosis. People with mental health issues also have a higher rate of drug use problems.</p>
        
        <p>Financial issues</p>
        Some drugs can be very expensive – the street price of illicit drugs depends on availability and demand. If you have become dependent on a drug, you could end up in financial trouble
        
    <p>Illicit drug use causes a significant burden to the Australian economy. For example, the estimated total social costs for methamphetamine alone are around $5 billion annually – through crime, loss of productivity and increased health care costs.</p>
        
    <p>Relationships</p>
        Because drugs can change your behaviour, they can affect your relationships with family and friends. There is an increased risk of injury and/or assault to both yourself and other people.
        
        Legal issues
        Many drugs are illegal and you can be fined, or sent to prison, for having them. If convicted of a drug offence, you could end up with a criminal record – this can make it harder to get a job, apply for a loan, or travel overseas.
        
        Learn more about Australia’s drug laws.
        
        <p>Drugs in sport</p>
        Sports people and professional athletes who use illegal substances risk damaging not only their physical health, but also their reputation and the integrity of their sport.
        
        <p>The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) protects the health of athletes and implements anti-doping programs, including drug testing.</p>
        
        <p>Drugs and driving</p>
        Alcohol and other drugs can seriously affect your driving skills. You are more likely to have an accident, injuring yourself and/or others. The crash could be fatal.
        
        The different types of drugs affect your driving ability in the following ways:
        
       <p> stimulants – driving too fast or erratically, being aggressive behind the wheel, reduced vision, you can feel overconfident
        depressants – driving too slowly, falling asleep at the wheel, veering out of your lane, your reactions are slower
        hallucinogens – distorted vision, hard to correctly judge distances, seeing things that aren’t there.</p>
